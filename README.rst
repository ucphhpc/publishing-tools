Usage
-----

The package provides a set of complementary tools that can be used as part of publishing packages and container images.
In particular, the package can help with optimizing the workflow for signing, checksumming, and verifying the integrity of artifacts to be published.
The package provides the ``publish``, ``sign``, and ``verify`` tools.

The overall ``publish`` tool can be used to publish a source to a destination, optionally with an associated checksum and signature.
The ``publish`` tool currently supports two types of ``sources``, i.e. either a file or (`Podman <https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/>`_) container image.
The selection can be controlled via the ``--publish-type`` argument that specifies what type of source should be published:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ publish.py [-h]
        [--publish-type {file,container_image_archive}]
        [--with-checksum]
        [--checksum-algorithm {sha256,sha512,md5}]
        [--with-signature]
        [--signature-source {source_input,generated_checksum_file}]
        [--signature-generator {gpg}]
        [--signature-key SIGNATURE_KEY]
        [--signature-args SIGNATURE_ARGS]
        [--signature-output SIGNATURE_OUTPUT]
        [--verbose]
        source
        destination

        positional arguments:
        source                The source input to publish.
        destination           Destination path to publish to. Either an output directory or an archive file.

        options:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        --publish-type {file,container_image_archive}, -pt {file,container_image_archive}
        --with-checksum, -wc  Whether to also publish a checksum file in the destination directory. (default: False)
        --checksum-algorithm {sha256,sha512,md5}, -ca {sha256,sha512,md5}
                                Which checksum algorithm to use when --with-checksum is enabled. (default: sha256)
        --with-signature, -ws
                                Whether to also publish a signed edition of the source to the specified destination directory. (default: False)
        --signature-source {source_input,generated_checksum_file}, -ss {source_input,generated_checksum_file}
                                What should be used as input for the signature. Default is the source file. If --with-checksum is enabled, the checksum
                                file can also be used. (default: source_input)
        --signature-generator {gpg}, -sg {gpg}
                                Which signature tool to use when --with-signature is enabled. (default: gpg)
        --signature-key SIGNATURE_KEY, -sk SIGNATURE_KEY
                                Which key to sign with when --with-signature is enabled. (default: None)
        --signature-args SIGNATURE_ARGS, -sa SIGNATURE_ARGS
                                Optional arguments to give the selected --signature-generator. (default: --sign --batch)
        --signature-output SIGNATURE_OUTPUT, -so SIGNATURE_OUTPUT
                                Path of the generated signature file. Default is None, which will output to the FILE path with the --signature-generator
                                extension (default: None)
        --with-signature-key-output, -wsko
                                Flag on whether the --signature-key should be written to a file in the destination directory. (default: False)
        --signature-key-output-path SIGNATURE_KEY_OUTPUT_PATH, -skop SIGNATURE_KEY_OUTPUT_PATH
                                The path to where the --with-signature-key-output should be written. If None is set, the default is the same path as the 'file' with an `.asc` extension. (default: None)
        --signature-key-output-args SIGNATURE_KEY_OUTPUT_ARGS, -skoa SIGNATURE_KEY_OUTPUT_ARGS
                                Optional arguments to give the selected --signature-generator when generating the key. (default: --armor --export)
        --verbose, -v         Flag to enable verbose output. (default: False)

After a source has been published with a checksum and/or signature, the ``verify`` tool can be used to verify the integrity of the source.
Information on using this tool can be discovered via the usual `--help` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    verify.py [-h]
        [--verify-with-additional-files VERIFY_WITH_ADDITIONAL_FILES [VERIFY_WITH_ADDITIONAL_FILES ...]]
        [--verify-command {gpg}]
        [--verify-args VERIFY_ARGS]
        [--with-checksum]
        [--checksum-digest-file CHECKSUM_DIGEST_FILE]
        [--checksum-original-file CHECKSUM_ORIGINAL_FILE]
        [--checksum-algorithm {sha256,sha512,md5}]
        [--verbose]
        file
        key

        positional arguments:
        file                  Path of the file to verify.
        key                   The key that the --verify-command should use to verify the file with.

        options:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        --verify-with-additional-files VERIFY_WITH_ADDITIONAL_FILES [VERIFY_WITH_ADDITIONAL_FILES ...], -vwaf VERIFY_WITH_ADDITIONAL_FILES [VERIFY_WITH_ADDITIONAL_FILES ...]
                                Additional files to verify with the key. This is useful when verifying a detached signature. (default: [])
        --verify-command {gpg}, -vc {gpg}
                                Command to verify the file with. (default: gpg)
        --verify-args VERIFY_ARGS, -va VERIFY_ARGS
                                Additional arguments to pass to the verify command. (default: --verify --batch --status-fd 0 --with-colons)
        --with-checksum, -wc  Whether to also verify a checksum file. (default: False)
        --checksum-digest-file CHECKSUM_DIGEST_FILE, -cdf CHECKSUM_DIGEST_FILE
                                Path of the file containing the digest to validate against when --with-checksum is enabled. If none is provided, the checksum file will be assumed to be in the same directory as
                                the verify file with the same base name and the selected --checksum-algorithm extension. (default: None)

        --checksum-algorithm {sha256,sha512,md5}, -ca {sha256,sha512,md5}
                                Which checksum algorithm to use for verification when --with-checksum is enabled. (default: sha256)
        --verbose, -v         Flag to enable verbose output. (default: False)

Examples
--------

The following examples illustrate how the tools can be used to publish a file, a container image, and how to verify the integrity of the published source.

Publishing a file
-----------------

Publishing a file with a checksum and signature requires that a valid signature key is available to sign the file with.
If GPG is used as the signature generator, the list of available keys can be discovered via the command ``gpg --list-keys``.

First we create a dummy file to publish:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo "Hello, World!" > /tmp/hello.txt

Then we can publish the file with a checksum and signature:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ publish --publish-type file --with-checksum --with-signature --signature-key <key_id_or_name> /tmp/hello.txt /tmp/hello_published.txt

This command will generate a checksum file and a signature file in the destination directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ls /tmp/hello_published.txt*
    hello.txt
    hello.txt.gpg
    hello.txt.sha256

By default, the generated signature file is named after the original file and is a self contained signature file.
The checksum file is named after the original file and has the checksum algorithm extension appended to the file name.
However, when using the default GPG signaturer, and a detached signature is desired, the ``--signature-args`` option can be used to specify the ``--detach-sign`` argument.
An example of generating a detached signature can be seen below:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ publish --publish-type file --with-checksum --with-signature --signature-key <key_id_or_name> --signature-args "--detach-sign --batch" /tmp/hello.txt /tmp/hello_published.txt

Another common option, when publishing a file, is to use the checksum file as the source for the signature.
This can be done by setting the ``--signature-source generated_checksum_file`` flag.
In this case, the checksum file will be used as the input for the signature generation.
The following command illustrates how this can be done:

.. code-block:: bash

    publish --publish-type file --with-checksum --with-signature --signature-source generated_checksum_file --signature-key <key_id_or_name> /tmp/hello.txt /tmp/hello_published.txt

The result of this command will be the same as the previous example, but the signature will be generated based on the checksum file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ls /tmp/hello_published.txt*
    hello.txt
    hello.txt.sha256
    hello.txt.sha256.gpg

Furthermore, the ``publish`` tool also lets you specify a custom signature output path with the ``--signature-output`` option.
This can be useful when the signature file should be placed in another location than the default ones generated by the tool.

Publish the signature key as part of the publication
----------------------------------------------------

When publishing a file with a signature, it can be useful to output the signature key to a file in the destination directory.
The signature key can then be used to verify the signature at a later time.

To output the signature key to a file in the destination directory, the ``--with-signature-key-output`` flag should be set.
In addition, the ``--signature-key-output-path`` argument can be used to specify the path to the output file. If this is not set, the default path will be the same as the file with an ``.asc`` extension.
To accomplish this task, the `publish` tool uses the ``--signature-generator`` with the associated ``--signature-key-output-args`` arguments to output the signature key file.
Therefore, the ``--signature-key-output-args`` can be used to specify additional arguments to the signature generator when generating the key.

An example of outputting the signature key to a file in the destination directory can be seen below:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ publish --publish-type file --with-signature --with-signature-key-output --signature-key <key_id_or_name> /tmp/hello.txt /tmp/hello_published.txt

This command will generate a signature key file ``hello_published.txt.asc`` in the destination directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ls /tmp/hello_published.txt*
    hello_published.txt
    hello_published.txt.gpg
    hello_published.txt.asc

Publishing a container image
----------------------------

To publish a container image, the publish tool expects that the ``--publish-type container_image_archive`` flag is set.
In addition, the required positional `source` argument is expected to be set to the container image name or its id.
Finally, the destination should be set to the path where the container image archive should be published:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ publish --publish-type container_image_archive --with-checksum --with-signature --signature-key <key_id_or_name> <container_image_name_or_id> /tmp/container_image.tar

The result of this command in the destination directory will be a container image archive, a checksum file calculated based on the generated container image archive file, and finally a signed version of the archived file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ls /tmp/container_image.tar*
    container_image.tar
    container_image.tar.gpg
    container_image.tar.sha256

Similairly to the file publishing, the checksum file can be also used as the source for the signature generation.

Verifying a file publication
----------------------------

To verify a signed file publication, the ``verify`` tool can be used.
The tool expects a path to the file to be verified and a valid key used to verify the file via the selected ``--verify-command``.
Currently the tool only supports GPG as the verification command, but that may be extended in the future.
In addition to signature verification, the tool can also verify a checksum file if the ``--with-checksum`` flag is set.
When this flag is set, the tool requires that both the signature and checksum checks will pass for the verification to be successful.

An example of a simple verification of a signed file with an associated checksum file can be seen below:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ verify --with-checksum /tmp/hello_published.txt.gpg <key_id_or_name>

With this command, the verify tool will automatically try to discover the checksum digest file and the original published file in the same directory as the file to verify.
If the expected files are not present in the same directory, then the ``--checksum-digest-file``/``--checksum-original-file`` arguments can be used to specify the paths to the required files.
The result of the verification will be a message that indicates if the verification was successful or not.

To verify a signed checksum file, the signed checksum file can be used as the input for the verification.
However, since the file layout naming of the checksum and signature file is different, the ``--checksum-digest-file <path`` argument needs to be set to the path of the checksum file.
Whereas the ``--checksum-original-file <path>`` argument needs to be set to the path of the original file that the checksum file was generated for:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ verify --with-checksum --checksum-digest-file /tmp/hello_published.txt.sha256 --checksum-original-file hello_published.txt hello_published.sha256.gpg <key_id_or_name>

Furthermore, the ``verify`` tool also lets you verify a detached signature. To accomplish this, the ``verify`` tool requires that the ``--verify-with-additional-files`` flag is set to the path of the original file that the detached signature was generated for.
An example of verifying a detached signature can be seen below:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ verify --verify-with-additional-files /tmp/hello.txt /tmp/hello.txt.gpg <key_id_or_name>


Verifying a container image publication
---------------------------------------

Similarly to the file verification, the container image verification can be done with the ``verify`` tool.
After a container image achive has been published, the verification can be done with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ verify --with-checksum /tmp/container_image.tar.gpg <key_id_or_name>

The requirements for the verification are the same as for the file verification, i.e. that the signature and checksum checks both need to pass for the verification to be successful.
As with the file verification, the generated checksum file can be used as the input for the signature verification, if it was selected to be signed as part of the publication.
